To learn Python, I was interested in playing around with a similar framework such as Sinatra or Rails. Bottle seemed to fit the bill and has a good commit frequency. I missed a lot of the out-of-the-box standards and conventions provided by Rails, so I am attempting to do that with mongo-in-a-bottle. Also, I am not aware of many other projects actively using pystache.

From getting a usable blogging system up and running, I hope to extract the standards and conventions into a framework that can be cloned by others to get started using bottle and pystache.
